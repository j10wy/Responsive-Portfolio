#### Converting from fixed/static layout to a responsive layout

- I used [RQRWD](http://rqrwd.com/) to help me calculate the ratios for each section of the page. 

- I grouped the media queries with each section of the layout. I am not sure if its best to only write 1 media query for each size we're targeting, but it helped me better understand what is happening with each section.

- There is an issue on the gallery page between widths 805px and 959px, where the margin-right on each portfolio item is causing the images to stack, thought the site works at all of required sizes in the HW instructions.
